Encountered a bug. Unable to make a request to the kayak API form localhost, and thus unable to test the integration of the 
ImageList page with the GetFlightInfo Feature. 
Will try to run on a server to test the integration.

MAIN ISSUE!

I did not have a clear understanding of front and back end. 
I PUT EVERYTHING into frontend
Need to fix!

The Cross-origin resource sharing problem is solved by properly seperating the project into frontend and backend
New issue: I can't directly receive the data from the API and then update the page
I need to implement useState and useEffect to solve this
